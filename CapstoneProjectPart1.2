    "A well-known biotechnology company is considering opening a new location in the Phoenix Metropolitan area. Their main objective is to research the coronavirus, implement clinical trials, and ultimately find a cure to save lives. They prefer to have a location where there have been many confirmed cases, therefore geographic data would be useful. Foursquare can elaborate on the geographic data with nearby locations. "

    "Reasoning: Each data set was collected with the intention of cleaning and wrangling the data to find the appropriate jurisdictions that are going to be examined. Three data sets were examined to enhance the overall knowledge of the area. Several other factors related to the coronavirus were given in the data set to include all variables, and to provide a more comprehensive analysis. \n",
    "Limitations: Each data set has delays in reporting, some data is incomplete and it does not provide an entire picture at the state level. Therefore, some data may be underestimated. Another consideration is the level of comorbidities that are associated with the disease. Although this is preliminary data, these factors were not included in the data sets. "
